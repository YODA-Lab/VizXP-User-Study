    <h4 ><a id="Thinking_before_acting_2"></a>Thinking before acting!</h4>
    <p>Classical planning is the task of coming up with a sequence of actions that will achieve a particular goal. Within the realm of AI, planning is mostly concerned with developing “agents” that can come up with such actions on their own.</p>
    <p>In particular, a planning problem consists of an initial state (where we start in the environment), a goal state (where we want to go in the environment), and a set of actions that we can execute to transistion between states in the environment. The available set of actions are specific to each planning problem and are described in the <em>Domain</em> of the planning problem.</p>
    <p>A solution to a planning problem, called a <em>plan</em>, is a sequence of actions, which when executed would allow us to transition from the initial states to the goal states. The cost of a plan is measured by its plan length, which is the number of actions it contains. The shortest plan (cost-minimal) for a given problem is called an <em>optimal</em> plan.</p>
    <h2 ><a id="Components_of_a_Planning_Task_11"></a>Components of a Planning Task.</h2>
    <p>Suppose we have a planning problem which involves telling a robot to pick up a box from a table. We will use this example to describe the components of a planning task:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Objects</strong>: Things in the world that interest us, e.g, <em>box B</em>, <em>table T</em>, <em>robot R</em></li>
    <li><strong>Predicates</strong>: Properties of objects that we are interested in; Can be <em>True</em> or <em>False</em>.<br>
    For example, <em>ontable(B, T)</em> could tell us that box <em>B</em> is on table <em>T</em>, and <em>free( R)</em> could tell us the robots hand is free</li>
    <li><strong>Initial states</strong>: The states of the world that we start in. If initially the box is on the table and the robot’s hand is free, the initial state can be represented as a combination of <em>ontable(B, T)</em> and <em>free( R)</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>Goal states</strong>: The states of the world that we want to reach. In the example, the goal state can be <em>holding(B, R)</em>. In other words, the box should be in the robot’s hand after the plan is executed.</li>
    <li><strong>Actions</strong>: Ways of changing the state of the world. An action <em>Pick-up(B, T, R)</em> may be used to say that we want the robot <em>R</em> to pick up box <em>B</em> from table <em>T</em>.<br>
    Each action comprises of the following conditions:<br>
    i) <strong>Precondtions</strong>: States that have to be <em>True</em> in order to exectute the action. For <em>Pick-up(B,T,R)</em>, the box <em>B</em> should be on the table <em>T</em>, and the robot’s hand should be free. Hence, this action will have the preconditions <em>ontable(B, T)</em> and <em>free( R)</em>. Since these conditions are satisfied in the initial state, this action is possible.<br>
    ii) <strong>Addition effects</strong>: States that become <em>True</em> after we execute the action. For <em>Pick-up(B,T,R)</em>, the action will result in <em>holding(B, R)</em> being <em>True</em> after the action is completed.<br>
    iii) <strong>Deletion effects</strong>: States that become <em>False</em> after we execute the action. For <em>Pick-up(B,T,R)</em>, <em>ontable(B, T)</em> and <em>free( R)</em> will be <em>False</em> after the action is completed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then, the <strong>plan</strong> for this problem would be just one step long: <em>P</em> = { <em>Pick-up(B, T, R)</em> }. The reason is that, the initial state satisfies the preconditions of action <em>Pick-up(B, T, R)</em>, thus allowing us to execute it. After executing <em>Pick-up(B, T, R)</em>, we end up at the state, <em>holding(B, R)</em>, which is the goal state.</p>
    <p>In other more complicated problems, the plan may involve multiple steps, each acting upon the state after the previous action, to cumulatively result in the goal.</p>
